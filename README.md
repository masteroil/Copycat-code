# Copycat-code
You'll need to update your image paths in CopyCat.js to use your actual image file paths. The images object was originally defined in CopyCat.js, but we've moved it to CopyCatContainer.js so it can be accessed by both components. You may need to pass images as props from CopyCatContainer.js to CopyCat.js or find another way to access the images object in CopyCat.js.
